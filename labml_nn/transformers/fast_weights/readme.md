# [Fast weights transformer](https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/fast_weights/index.html)

This is an annotated implementation of the paper
[Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Memory Systems in PyTorch](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/2102.11174).

Here is the [annotated implementation](https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/fast_weights/index.html).
Here are [the training code](https://nn.labml.ai/transformers/fast_weights/experiment.html)
and a notebook for training a fast weights transformer on the Tiny Shakespeare dataset.
