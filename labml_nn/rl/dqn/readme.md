# [Deep Q Networks (DQN)](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/dqn/index.html)

This is a [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) implementation of paper
 [Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://papers.labml.ai/paper/1312.5602)
 along with [Dueling Network](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/dqn/model.html), [Prioritized Replay](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/dqn/replay_buffer.html)
 and Double Q Network.

Here is the [experiment](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/dqn/experiment.html) and [model](https://nn.labml.ai/rl/dqn/model.html) implementation.
